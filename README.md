# jenkins-python

Script functionality

1 ) Trigger a REMOTE jenkins job using the token

2 ) Wait for the job to complete

3 ) Fetch job id and parse the output console.


This script is very useful when we want to trigger the job remotely and monitor its status. We can even add email functionality in this to trigger notification to support/respective teams.
